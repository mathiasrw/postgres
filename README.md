PostgreSQL in the browser?
=====================================

This directory contains the source code distribution of the PostgreSQL database management system.

I love poking around in code - so to give my self a reason I will try to compile the source to asm.js (PGSQL in a browser).

Its not really a smart idea - but it could be fun to make it work...
